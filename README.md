# jokepapa.fun

jokepapa.fun operates on a dual-token model centered around $JOKE (the platform token) and AI-Agent Tokens (such as jokepapaâ€™s $PAPA). It is a decentralized platform built on the concept that "humor is an asset, and jokes can be traded." Through a community-driven DAO and autonomously operating AI agents, jokepapa.fun transforms humor into real economic value, enabling everyone to benefit from creating, sharing, and enjoying jokes.
